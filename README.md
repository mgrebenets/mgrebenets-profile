## Summary

I've been iOS developer for more than 11 years now.
What started as a hobby in 2007 is now my full time job and main area of expertise.

I strongly believe that best practices are essential for successful development and collaboration and therefore need to be established, followed and oftentimes enforced. _Warnings are Errors_ is an axiom for me. I've been using tools like SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, Danger and other linters and formatters with great results. I even had a go at [implementing a Swift regactoring action](https://mgrebenets.github.io/swift/2019/02/01/swift-refactoring-intro).

One of my key strenghts is designing modular architecture and building reusable native frameworks. I have experience with using various dependency management tools and applying right design patterns while building software.

I've got great passion for build and automation tools. Digging deep into Apple code signing process led me all the way into Fastlane core contributors team. Recently I've been using Buck to build a dozen of internal frameworks.

To be able to apply all the tools, I've worked hands on with continuous integrations solutions, such as Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity and Xcode Bots.
